Analysis and Configurations of XMRig-for-Android

In recent years, cryptocurrency mining has established itself as an interesting option for those seeking extra income. With the market's growth, understanding how to optimize mining on mobile devices, such as Android smartphones, becomes essential. This article explores the main performance configurations of XMRig-for-Android, analyzing both technical parameters and potential earnings.

Performance Configurations

Low Performance

For those who prefer a more conservative use of their device, low-performance settings include:

CPU Usage: 40%

Maximum CPU Temperature: 50°C

Maximum Battery Temperature: 45°C

Priority: 0


This configuration is ideal for users who want to mine without heavily impacting their device’s performance.

Medium Performance

If you're willing to increase performance a bit, you can opt for:

CPU Usage: 60%

Maximum CPU Temperature: 60°C

Maximum Battery Temperature: 50°C

Priority: 1


This approach offers a balance between efficiency and safety, allowing for more effective mining.

High Performance

For the adventurous who want to extract maximum power from their device, high-performance settings are:

CPU Usage: 100%

Maximum CPU Temperature: 80°C

Maximum Battery Temperature: 60°C

Priority: 5


It’s important to monitor the temperature to avoid device damage, but the potential gains can be significant.

RandomX Algorithm Settings

The RandomX algorithm, used for mining cryptocurrencies like Monero, has its settings adjusted according to performance:

Low Performance: Standard Mode, 1GB Pages: No, Cache QoS: Yes

Medium Performance: Auto Mode, 1GB Pages: No, Cache QoS: No

High Performance: Fast Mode, 1GB Pages: Yes, Cache QoS: Yes


These options ensure that the miner operates optimally based on user needs.

Thermal Control

Maintaining thermal control is vital during mining, and the recommended settings are:

Low Performance: Maximum Temperature: 50°C, Pause: 5000 ms

Medium Performance: Maximum Temperature: 60°C, Pause: 5000 ms

High Performance: Maximum Temperature: 80°C, Pause: 10000 ms


These pauses help prevent overheating and prolong the device's lifespan.

Potential Earnings

Earnings from mining can vary significantly, depending on the hash rate and network difficulty. You can estimate monthly income based on the chosen settings and market conditions.

JSON Settings

Performance configurations are often stored in JSON files, making modification and optimization easier. Each performance level has a specific set of parameters that control CPU usage, temperature limits, and algorithm settings. This flexibility allows for quick adjustments based on the miner's needs.

Blockchain Information

To track real-time data about blocks and hashes, it’s recommended to use blockchain explorers like XMRChain or Blockchain.com.
